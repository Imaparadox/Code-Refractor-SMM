## Description 
When a user views the source code, they will find a majority of divs have been changed to fit a more semantic structure. In addition, the page has been refitted to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. There are now accessible alt attributes in image elements, and heading attributes fall in sequential order. And finally, when a user views the title element, they will now find a concise, descriptive title.
